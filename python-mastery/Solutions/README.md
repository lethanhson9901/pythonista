# Solutions

This directory contains fully worked out solution code for every
exercise.  The code is written to be runnable from this directory.
When taking the course, I would encourage you to try and come up
with your own solution first.   However, if you're stuck or if
everything has become broken, you can come here to get a fresh
copy of code to work with.
