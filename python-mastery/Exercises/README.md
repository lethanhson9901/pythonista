Welcome to the Python Mastery course. This
directory, `pythonmaster` is where you find support files
related to the class exercises.  It is also where you will be doing
your work.

This course requires the use of Python 3.6 or newer.  If you are
using Python 2, most of the material still applies, but you will
have to make minor code modifications here and there. 

- [`PythonMastery.pdf`](../PythonMastery.pdf) is a PDF that contains
all of the presentation slides.

- The [`Exercises/`](index.md) folder is where you
find all the class exercises.

- The [`Data/`](../Data/) folder is where you find data files, scripts, and
other files used by the exercises.

- The [`Solutions/`](../Solutions/) folder contains complete solution code for
various exercises.  Each problem has its own directory.  For example,
the solution to exercise 3.2 can be found in the [`Solutions/3_2/`](../Solutions/3_2/) directory.

Every attempt has been made to make sure exercises work.  However, it's 
possible that you will find typos or minor mistakes. If you find any
errors, please let me know so that I can fix them for future editions
of the course.
