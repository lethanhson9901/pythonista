# Exercise 2.2 - Solution

There is no official solution for this exercise--you need rely on your
current Python knowledge.  However, there are a few tips that can
help.

- For problems where you need to determine uniqueness, use a set. Sets aren't allowed to
have duplicates.

- If you need to tabulate data, consider using a dictionary that maps keys to a numeric
count.  For example, to count rides on each bus route, you could make a dictionary that
maps the route name to the total ride count for that route.  A `Counter` object from
`collections` is perfect for this task.

- If you need to keep data in order or sort data, store it in a list.

- You can make Python data structures out of almost anything.  For
example, dictionaries of sets, nested dictionaries, etc.  You might
need to do this to answer questions 3 and 4.
